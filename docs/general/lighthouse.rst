Lighthouse - communication relay
================================

Laniakea modules are almost always their own executables or even
services. This allows to run them on separate machines, to improve
security by isolation or to balance load.

The *Lighthouse* core module is a daemon that provides a way for
Laniakea modules to get notified about changes, distribute jobs to them
and receive information to store in the database.

There can be an arbitrary number of Lighthouse instances on multiple
servers. Due to Lighthouse directly distributing jobs and interacting
with the central database, currently each Lighthouse server needs write
access to a Postgres database.

About the name
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A lighthouse guides ships on the sea to stay on course. The same way the
Lighthouse module is a fixpoint for Laniakea modules, and is the place
they gets tasks and information from (if they donâ€™t have a direct
database connection already).
