Rubicon - import artifacts into a trusted area
==============================================

Rubicon imports (build)artifacts from a less-trusted space into a
trusted area. It verifies GPG signatures of the artifacts against a
trusted keyring, and if the files can be trusted, moves them to a
predefined location.

It can be used for importing arbitrary files, as long as they are
accompanied by a signed ``.dud`` (“Debian Upload Description”) file.

About the name
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `Rubicon <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubicon>`__ river was
historically the border between the Roman province Cisalpine Gaul and
Italy. Governors of northern provinces were not allowed to cross it with
their troups, doing so was a capital offense (something that a certain
Julius Caesar famously ignored). The ``rubicon`` tool ensures only
trusted allies cross the border in Laniakea.
