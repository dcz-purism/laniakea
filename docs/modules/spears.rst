Spears - migrate packages between suites
========================================

Spears is a wrapper around ``Britney2``, which is used to migrate
packages from a source to a target suite as long as they do not break
installability in the target suite and fulfill other criteria, e.g. pass
tests or fulfill a time limit.

internet).
